\section{Introduction}

In this laboratory session, the main objective was to handle the UART protocol dealing directly with the hardware registers. The Cyclone V implements the UART protocol for both receiving and transmitting data, it interfaces with a terminal emulator program on a PC.

The same configuration of the previous laboratory (laboratory \#2) was used, except for the following changes
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \textit{altera\_avalon\_uart\_driver} was disabled in the Board Support Package (BSP)
	\item The physical switch \#9 (SW9) was set to the 1 position
\end{enumerate}
The UART was configured accordingly to the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Baud Rate changed during the projects (default: 115200)
	\item Data bits = 8
	\item Stop bits = 1
	\item Parity = Even
\end{itemize}
These register were manipulated to handle the UART behaviour:

As reported by the \textit{Embedded Peripherals IP User Guide} the addresses of these registers are
\begin{itemize}
	\item rxdata - 0x08001060
	\item txdata - 0x08001064
	\item status - 0x08001068
	\item control - 0x0800106C
	\item divisor - 0x08001070
\end{itemize}
