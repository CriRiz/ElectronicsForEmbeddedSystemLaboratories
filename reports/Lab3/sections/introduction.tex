\section{Introduction}

In this laboratory session we handled the UART protocol dealing directly with the hardware register. The Cyclone V implements the UART protocol for both receiving and transmitting data, and it will interface with a terminal emulator program on a PC.

In this laboratory we used the same configuration of the previous laboratory (laboratory \#2) apart from a change in the Board Support Package (BSP) where we disabled ..? and the physical switch \#9 (SW9)  \\
In this laboratory we configured the UART accordingly to  the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Baud Rate changed during the projects
  \item Data bits = 8
  \item Stop bits = 1
  \item Parity = Even
\end{itemize}
In order to handle the UART, these register were manipulated:

As reported by the \textit{Embedded Peripherals IP User Guide} the addresses to access to these registers are
\begin{itemize}
  \item rxdata - 0x08001060
  \item txdata - 0x08001064
  \item status - 0x08001068
  \item control - 0x0800106C
  \item divisor - 0x08001070
\end{itemize}
