\subsection{Project \#1}
As a first experiment, the PWM signal generation was verified using an oscilloscope, as represented in Figure~(\ref{fig:osc1}) to Figure~(\ref{fig:osc6}).\\
Subsequently, it was compared the theoretical obtained value with the experimental ones. The discrepancies between the two datasets can be observed comparing the two tables (\ref{tab:comp}) and (\ref{tab:exp}).
There are differences between the real value of $T_{ON}, T_{OFF}, T_{PWM}$, these are likely due to to $n_\delta$ value. An increase of this value lead to a better precision, in fact:\\
For $n_\delta = 12$, with experimental value:
\begin{align*}
    \delta = \frac{T_{ON}}{T} = 0.26 \Rightarrow 26\%
\end{align*}
This result deviates from the desired duty cycle $\delta = 20\%$.\\
In contrast, with $n_\delta = 100$, the precision improves:
