\section{Introduction}
This laboratory exercise centers on using the Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converter, which is implemented on the DE1-SoC development board linked with external analog components.
The Cyclone V FPGA is used to build the SAR logic in VHDL, while the on-board ADV7123 video Digital-to-Analog Converter and an external LM393 comparator are used to perform the analog comparison that is required during the conversion process.
The goal of the following projects is to reproduce the classical SAR ADC and testing it in different scenarios.
